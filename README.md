Explore the Star Wars Universe

This app allows users to view lists of Star Wars characters, vehicles, planets, films, starships and species. They can search on pages for a specific planet, character or vehicle they might be looking for. They can click on an individual element and view even more information. The Star Wars data is compiled from a third party API called <a href="https://swapi.co/" target="_blank">SWAPI</a>.

##Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS
- Angular.js
- JavaScript/jQuery

##Plans
As this project continues I plan on adding connections between pages.
