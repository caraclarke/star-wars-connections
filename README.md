Explore the Star Wars Universe

This app allows users to view lists of Star Wars characters, vehicles and planets. They can search on pages for a specific planet, character or vehicle they might be looking for. They can click on an individual element and view even more information. The Star Wars data is compiled for a third party API called <a href="https://swapi.co/">SWAPI</a.
